M001,Router Troubleshooting Guide,hardware,"When experiencing dropped calls with WiFi calling, first check router placement. Ensure router is centrally located and away from interference sources like microwaves or thick walls. Try resetting the router by unplugging for 30 seconds then plugging back in. Check firmware is updated to latest version through admin panel. If issues persist, try changing WiFi channel in router settings.",Router,WiFi,2023-01-10
M002,Network Tower Operations,infrastructure,"Network tower outages can cause dropped calls in specific geographic areas. Outages may be scheduled for maintenance or unplanned due to power issues or equipment failure. During outages, customers in affected areas will experience service disruption. Estimated resolution times vary based on issue severity.",Tower,4G/5G,2023-01-05
M003,SIM Card Troubleshooting,hardware,"Faulty SIM cards can cause intermittent service issues including dropped calls. Signs include frequent network disconnections and 'SIM not recognized' errors. To test, power off device, carefully remove SIM, clean contacts gently with soft cloth, reinsert and power on. If issues persist, SIM replacement is recommended.",SIM,All,2022-12-15
M004,Bandwidth Management,network,"During peak usage hours (typically 7-9PM), network congestion may cause slow internet speeds. System automatically prioritizes voice traffic over data. Customers experiencing slow speeds should try non-peak hours for large downloads. For persistent issues, bandwidth allocation for the area may need review.",Network,All,2023-01-12
M005,WiFi Calling Setup,service,"WiFi calling can resolve dropped call issues in areas with weak cellular signal but strong WiFi. To enable: go to Phone settings, find WiFi calling option and toggle on. Ensure connected to stable WiFi network. Test by enabling airplane mode while keeping WiFi on. Service uses internet connection for calls and messages.",Software,WiFi,2022-11-20
M006,Signal Boosters,hardware,"Signal boosters amplify existing cellular signals to improve reception in specific locations. Recommended for customers with consistently weak signal at home or office. Requires installation with external antenna in area with some signal, connected to indoor amplifier. Not effective in complete dead zones.",Booster,4G/5G,2022-10-25
M007,Data Usage Optimization,service,"Unexpected data usage often caused by background apps. Instruct customers to check usage by app in device settings. Common culprits include video apps auto-playing, cloud backup services, and map applications running in background. Recommend turning off background data for high-usage apps.",Software,All,2023-01-08

Customers should update payment information through online portal or customer service.",N/A,N/A,2022-12-20
M009,Cell Tower Handoff Protocol,network,"When moving between coverage areas, calls transfer between towers in handoff process. Dropped calls during movement often indicate handoff failure. System logs show tower IDs and signal strength at disconnection point. Areas with known handoff issues should be flagged for engineering review.",Tower,4G/5G,2023-01-15
M010,Fiber Optic Infrastructure,infrastructure,"Fiber optic damage causes widespread outages affecting all services. Typical causes include construction work, weather events, or animal damage. Repair requires specialized equipment and technicians. Temporary rerouting may restore partial service while repairs completed. Full documentation of damage location essential for efficient repair.",Fiber,All,2022-11-30
